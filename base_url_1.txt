Our Mission

Our DNA is reflected in our name. Gigalogy is a contraction of Giga and Analogy. Giga represents a huge number, and analogy, a comparison between one thing to another for explanation. In the world of Artificial Intelligence, there could be billions of patterns that we can not imagine with our mind. Our mission is to make sure these unknown patterns can be transformed into something easy to understand and meaningful for everyone.

User first approach
Innovative solutions
Industry knowledge
Team of professionals
From gut-driven to data driven organization

We are aiming a cultural transition from gut driven, historical precedent based organization to data driven and / or data informed organization for our customers.



Deliver solutions that result in good experience

AI solutions that are able to deliver products and services that are useful, better than the alternatives, are enjoyable and delightful, and result in good experience.

We're always looking for talent
